Revision history for Drupal-Admin

0.01    Date/time
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02	Wed Mar 25 15:02:12 MDT 2009
	Fixed version (.01 -> 0.02) to make cpanplus happy.
	Minor documentation change.

0.03	Mon Apr  6 13:52:57 MDT 2009
	Changed ModuleState.pm to use the tick() method instead
        of field() for checkboxes in commit(). This is problematic
	since tick() doesn't support an index argument and checkbox
	names are not guaranteed to be unique.

0.04	Tue Apr 14 11:41:41 MDT 2009
	Added check for access denied in Drupal::Admin::update().
	This can happen if we are redirected from http to https.
