Drupal-Admin v 0.03

This is a minimal screenscraping interface to the drupal admin
pages. Its primary purpose (at the moment) is to provide a means to
automate drupal core upgrades. There is a sample upgrade script at
examples/drupal-upgrade. 

This is ALPHA quality code. I would NOT recommend using this to
perform a drupal core upgrade on a production site. Please send along
patches!
